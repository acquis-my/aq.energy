        question: "Is this solar installation legal?",
        answer: "Yes! The NEM program is instituted by the Malaysian Government to encourage solar system installations. It is under the purview of Suruhanjaya Tenaga (ST) and Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA). A certificate is issued to customers by SEDA after the installation is complete for the system."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you calculate your savings?",
        answer: "We calculate your savings based on current TNB tariff rates, based on the respective electricity bill that you have inserted to the estimator. The savings per month is averaged throughout the year, including monsoon (rainy) months and sunnier months. Our savings estimate is reinforced by the data that we collect from our previous customers through the system monitoring application."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I am working during the afternoon?",
        answer: "Under the Net-Energy Metering (NEM) program, any unused power will be sold back to TNB at the same tariff rate as your rate of purchase for homeowners. Commercial and Industrial customers will sell their unused power under the system marginal price (SMP). At the end of each month, your electricity purchase with TNB will be deducted from the systemâ€™s total export."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to clean my panels frequently?",
        answer: "No. We will help our customers monitor for any reduction in performance. Our high-quality panels contain a glass coating that prevents dust and dirt buildup. When it rains, it will clear out any stains that have accumulated on the panels."
    },
    {
        question: "Should I worry about maintenance?",
        answer: "Each of our solar systems include a monitoring software that allows us to troubleshoot performance issues online. Therefore, most issues can be identified and resolved without the need for a maintenance visit. If any maintenance visits are required, our teams will attend to them. Maintenance visits are included in the system price for the first 3 years (Residential), or 5 years (Commercial) for our standard package. Any issues that can be solved online remains free-of-charge."
    },
    {
        question: "What exactly is the NEM Program?",
        answer: "The Net-Energy Metering (NEM) Program is launched by the Malaysian Government to encourage the use of sustainable solar energy by allowing users to export their unused power back to TNB for a greater reduction of their electricity bills. Users will sign an agreement with TNB to guarantee the benefits of the program for 10 years. After 10 years, the program will lapse and the system will function under the self-consumption mode (SELCO)."
    },
    {
        question: "Do your systems include batteries?",
        answer: "Under the NEM program, batteries do not actually bring additional savings to customers and will only act as a backup during power blackouts. Installation of batteries will only incur an additional cost and is dependent on the system installation size."
    },
    {
        question: "Will the solar system provide power during a blackout ?",
        answer: "No. As the output of solar panels are intermittent (affected by clouds, rain), it is unsafe to supply power from the system during a blackout. The system will automatically shut down if it detects that there is no supply from the power grid. It will restart automatically when grid power is restored."
    },
    {
        question: "Are the estimated savings guaranteed?",
        answer: "The estimated savings are accurate based on our collected data from our customers, as well as software simulations. While we try our best to give you a system that reflects the savings, we cannot guarantee a fixed amount of power generated due to weather patterns that can temporarily impact system output. Contact us for historical data of systems currently in operation across Malaysia to get an idea of savings similar to your system and location."
    },
    {
        question: "Will there be any hidden charges during installation?",
        answer: "No. As we do everything from sales, installation and maintenance in-house, all costs pertaining to the application with regulatory bodies (SEDA, TNB), as well as installation are included within the system price. Maintenance visits are also included in the system price for the first 3 years (Residential), or 5 years (Commercial) for our standard package. Any issues that can be solved online remains free-of-charge."
